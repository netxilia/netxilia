Welcome to Netxilia.

This bundle is based on Jetty 7. The servers starts automatically on the 8080 port of the localhost.
The port is configured in the etc/jetty.xml configuration file. For more configuration options
please refer to the Jetty's documentation at http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/

Netxilia adds its main configuration files in the "netxilia" folder in user's home.
Derby and H2 default configurations will store there the data.

To access Netxilia, navigate to http://localhost:8080 with your preferred browser.

To be able to start Jetty from other folder and it's home directory, you have to set $JETTY_HOME in the bin/jetty.sh or bin/jetty-cygwin.sh files.
